===

My parents introduced me to computers before I was 5 years old. In the time since then and now, my life (and that of many others) has evolved to revolve largely around computers, which is really magical in a sense. We've created this made-up world with its own simple rules that's grown complex and lively. It's fantastical, and for better or for worse it's changed us forever.

Increasingly, the internet, software at large, and our participation in these systems are monopolized by large corporations whose interests do not align with individual users. Socio-economic opinions aside, I don't think this is good for the healthy growth of personalized, unique, and *simple* software - and by extension, our lives which are now inextricably integrated with these systems.

In parallel, software and hardware has grown complex and difficult to construct and maintain at the scales at which it's deployed. We build an ever-taller tower of technology which we grow ever-reliant on. When will the shoulders of giants be so high that it will take our entire lives to climb them? Or rather, when will we forget the details of the first giant's work?

I want to avoid the burden of this complexity and move the control of technology from corporate entities to individuals.

# Open Source & Ownership

Over the course of my relationship with computers, I've slowly gravitated towards open source software for my computing needs. I'm far from a purist, but I am cautious with programs dependent on the continued support of corporations I don't trust to care for me.

Open source, with all its shortcomings, gives us the ability to *own* and *modify* our software. The convenience (and market monopolization) of subscriptions has made it difficult to have a say in the digital spaces that we inhabit in our daily lives, hobbies, and work. Subscription services often funnel our money through controlling intermediaries whose interests are rarely aligned with consumers and creators.

We should be able to customize, maintain, and extend the longevity of the programs that we live with. At the very least, we shouldn't be held hostage with rent-only online-only models. With enough organization and funding, open source and decentralized sharing of software can be a solution.

# Self Hosting & Staying Local

Self hosting is hosting a web service on your own private computer as opposed to being handled by a third party's server (usually a corporation offering a service). The concept has existed since the dawn of the internet, but it seems to be gaining popularity among those frustrated with the tightening squeeze on consumers. For many, I think this is a fantastic solution and an amazing step towards independence. Many open source self-hosting projects exist to give you similar accessability and convenience as large corporation services.

I also think that not *everything* needs to be hosted.

To further push for simplicity, does everyone *really* benefit from uninturrupted online access to a media library, or data tracking apps, or an office suite, or streamable games? It's certainly useful for individual cases, but but the obsession with having every document and movie at our fingertips at all times on our dozen devices feels excessive. Lots of those 'services' can be just as effective while remaining a local file accessible on only one machine, backed up for safety. I think that's a system worth considering.

# Minimalism

If a lot of this sounds like a sort of digital minimalism, you'd be right. I really appreciate minimalism, and simplicity is a major part of it. I figure everything about minimalism has already been said elsewhere, but for completeness' sake, here's my summarized take on it: let go of the items, thoughts, and behaviors that don't enrich your life. Simple.

# Permacomputing

The thoughts above are only a narrow slice of topics discussed in [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/), for further reading. My values don't entirely align with the concept of permacomputing as presented in the linked site, but I completely support the efforts to increase accessability, reduce hardware and computational waste, avoid bloat and inefficiency, and encourage sharing and openness.
