> In a late 22nd century edition of "Architecting Worlds: A Simple Guide For Simple People", Stolmir et al.'s research in the proceduralization of organic synthesis was compiled into a short, 14 page synth-booklet. The manual was an attempt to raise interest in universal architecture in the general population, as well as to solidify the basic principles of organic pattern production.
> 
> It only sold half a million copies. Coincidentally, the information had not been fully experimented with, and as a result, a 17 year old teenager, and avid reader of science articles, inadvertedly created and destroyed 2 universes in a matter of microseconds, causing one of the most catastrophic events in human history.
> 
> The booklet was a hit thereafter.
