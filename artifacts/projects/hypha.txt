@[Hypha] is a realtime agent-based simulation of slime mold growth in both 2D and 3D. It's based on [Jeff Jones' paper on pattern formation in physarum transport networks](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579) and [Sage Jenson's explorations on the topic](https://sagejenson.com/physarum), and was created in Unity using compute shaders for agent behavior and volumetric rendering.
