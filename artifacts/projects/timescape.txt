title: @[TIMESCAPE], a known future.

===

In our limited lives, it is difficult to perceive time at scales unfamiliar to us. Today, we face an unprecedented vision of the future.

In @[TIMESCAPE], we explore a place untouched by human perception, time having overflowed into a new era. Deceptive contemplation. Regardless of how far we can see, should we claim responsibility  for a world whose past we directed?
