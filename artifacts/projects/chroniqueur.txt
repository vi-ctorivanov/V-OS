I worked on this Unity project as a technical artist with the goal of creating visual representations of procedrually generated content and helping define the map generation system for simulation purposes.

This includes architecting and developing procedural island data and biome generation, 3D mesh generation and texturing, map decor and object population, 2D asset matching for character and environment representation.
