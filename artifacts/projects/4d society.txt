title: @[4D SOCIETY] is a first person exploration game with navigational puzzles driven by experimental graphics.

===

Inspired by games like [Memories of a Broken Dimension](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544300/Memory_of_a_Broken_Dimension/), [Fugue In Void](https://moshelinke.itch.io/fugue-in-void), and [NaissanceE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265690/NaissanceE/), @[4D SOCIETY] explores environments filled with large-scale brutalist architecture, disorienting and experimental graphics, and a narrative with questions surrounding an alien ideology.

Currently, @[4D SOCIETY] is purely a proof of concept.

You are Research Officer Jazz, sent on a mission to investigate a paranormal phenomenon. Explore environments hidden behind the veil. Uncover surfaces where you look, and paint the world around you into existence. Embody the essence of curiosity: venture as far as you can, learn about the nature of this space, navigate non-euclidian environments, and discover the entities who created this new world.
