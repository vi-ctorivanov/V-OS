I worked at Kabam on a handful of Unity games as a technical artist. My primary focus was Shadows of Valdora (cancelled), where I:

\- overhauled the lighting system in all scenes, optimizing performance while bringing higher graphical fidelity and acting as a lighting artist.
\- managed and wrote documentation across both art and development teams.
\- created and utilized tools for project organization.
\- created tools for artists to test and validate assets.
\- acted as a bridge between artists and developers in regards to new technical features, technical constraints, and artistic control.
\- monitored performance and followed up with optimization passes on assets and inefficient rendering systems.
\- supported artists with various technical needs, both in regards to artistic processes in their production suites, as well as technical support for their machines.
\- dealt with graphics-related bugs and inconsistencies across the production.
\- set up and managed cutscene systems.
\- helped animators with rig and animation optimizations and integration.
\- assisted graphics programmers in designing, integrating, and documenting new shaders and graphics technologies.
\- integrated assets.
\- produced and integrated VFX.
\- defined and communicated new practices and techniques to refine the art production pipeline.

During downtime, I also helped the Shop Titans(shipped & live ops) team with similar tasks.

After Shadows of Valdora's cancellation, I focused on look dev (with an emphasis on technical implementations of graphics and character customization systems), rendering techniques, and designing and prototyping new art-tech for an unannounced title.
