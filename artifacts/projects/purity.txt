Technical documentation is available on [Github](https://github.com/vi-ctorivanov/Purity). @[Purity] aims to be a plug-and-play application, requiring nothing but a WAMP/LAMP setup (for local usage) / PHP-supported hosting, and the contents of its repository.

@[Purity] is also capable of generating static sites. For situations where PHP-supported hosting is unavailable, WAMP/LAMP can create a set of HTML files, fully ready to deploy.

@[Purity] allows for elaborate connectivity between its object-based data structures, easy navigation with the help of Apache's URI rewriting system, intuitive writing as a result of its multi-layered parser, and varied  usage due to its functional capacities as a content management system, and even a text-based game engine.

Its markup language is based on a simple syntax. It contains *attributes*, which are declared through the attribute name, followed by a colon, and the information to be attributed to said attribute.

```
name : text
image : directory>imagename
etc.
```

And it contains *rules*, which are inline elements used to format text according to predetermined functions.

```
\=[tag] link list
\=[text ++ text0] compact custom list
\![text] subtitle
\#[local link]
etc.
```
