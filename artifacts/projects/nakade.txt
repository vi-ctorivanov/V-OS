@[Nakade] was created for [Synchrony 2020](https://synchrony.nyc/2020/) in an 11-hour train ride from New York to Montreal, winning first place in the Demo category.

The project was created in collaboration with [LÃ©a Demeule](https://leademeule.com/), who took the role of graphics programmer for point cloud rendering, point cloud manipulation, post processing effects, and scene management.

All environments in this demo were made using photogrammetry of locations in New York and the train the jam took place in.
