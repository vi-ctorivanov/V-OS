title: The @[Log] is a timekeeping tool and data visualizer.

===

The @[Log] is a tool used for daily productivity logging and data visualization. Its data can be found in the sidebar of all project pages logged in it (including this one).

I've written about the @[Log] and my thoughts on @[time tracking here], after tracking my productivity every day for the last %[new Date().getFullYear() - 2017;](!) years.

&[time tracking]

The @[Log] is a long-running project that's gone through *many* iterations as a result of my evolving ideas around @[simplicity].

&[simplicity]

It began as a `.txt` file formatted more or less like a `.csv`, which was later transferred into an SQL database and visualized with PHP (code repository found [here](https://github.com/vi-ctorivanov/Log)), which was deprecated in favor of a more streamlined pipeline using google sheets, which was abandoned when I began to escape the google ecosystem and replaced again with a `.csv` file and an implementation in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with the [sqlseal plugin](https://github.com/h-sphere/sql-seal) (code repository found [here](https://github.com/vi-ctorivanov/SQLSeal-Charts-Examples)).

The data format has thankfully stayed consistent.

```
DATE        TIME  PROJECT      TASK            DIVISION   DETAILS
2017.08.30  1.0   V-OS         Development     Visual     Testing new headers.
```

Below are images of what the current obsidian-based visualization interface looks like.

Below are some images showcasing what the old PHP interface looked like, featuring an overview of all log entries and auto-generated pages for projects showing time allocation in different categories of productivity.
