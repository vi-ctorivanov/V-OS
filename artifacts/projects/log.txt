title: The @[Log] is a timekeeping tool and data visualizer.

===

The @[Log] is a tool used for daily output logging and data analysis.  Its data can be found in the sidebar of all project pages logged in it (including this one).

Data is entered into a simple spreadsheet of logs, which is then parsed using a Python script into mySQL queries. The original version used PHP to generate visualizations, but has been deprecated in favor of a more streamlined pipeline using google sheets.

Below are some images showcasing what this interface looked like, including an overview of all log entries, as well as the auto-generated pages for projects showing time allocation in different categories of productivity.

The purpose of the @[Log] is to study my work habits, spot patterns in the types of activities I engage in, and attempt to optimize my productivity. In short, tracking my time has helped me become more aware of how I spend it.
