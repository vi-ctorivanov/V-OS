===

[Fruits of Labour](https://www.opheliaspinosa.com/fruitsoflabour) is a short documentary directed by [Ophelia Spinosa](https://www.opheliaspinosa.com/).

> Interplaying the metaphor of grapes, this father-daughter documentary is characterized by the labour of love it is to make wine, but also the labour of love that is love itself.

My main role was based around scoring the movie with key pieces of music and motifs. During this project, I worked closely with Ophelia to determine instrumentation, composition, timing, and mixing.

The soundtrack features orchestral instruments in lo-fi soundscapes, with slight usage of electronic elements. It outlines the relationship between father and daughter, and explores both the bitter and sweet particularities of their connection.
