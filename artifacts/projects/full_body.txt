@[Full-body] allows you to create an exercise sequence, randomizes it, gives you generated text for each movement, shows you your progress, and tracks time over the course of your workout. It's simple and practical. I've used it for years with great success as I feel the gamification of the app helps motivate me to get through my workouts.
