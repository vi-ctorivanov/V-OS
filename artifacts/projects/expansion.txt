@[Expansion] is a music video for Ascendant's [Expansion](https://synphaera.bandcamp.com/track/expansion) which explores the abstract story of passive observations and eventual influence.

@[Expansion] was made using a combination of particle physics, webcam input, and audio analysis. The entirety of @[Expansion] is made in a single realtime take.
