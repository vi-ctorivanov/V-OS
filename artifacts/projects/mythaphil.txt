> Once filled with civilization, @[Mythaphil] is now nothing but overgrown vegetation and wildlife. Underneath the layers of plants lies the synthetic infrastructure of the world that used to be.
> 
> In its current state, @[Mythaphil] is a relatively safe planet. It supports a few million sentient inhabitants who have resorted to a primitive, but comfortable lifestyle. Among its small population, Di has been seen conducting what appears to be research in the last city of the planet.
