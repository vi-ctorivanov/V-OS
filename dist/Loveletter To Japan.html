				<h1><a href="Loveletter To Japan" class="localLink">Loveletter To Japan</a> is a collection of night photos from my final evenings in Tokyo.</h1><hr style="transform: translateX(0)"></hr><div id="content"><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/1.jpg" alt="Photograph of a dim set of modern buildings near a city train."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/2.jpg" alt="Zoom-in to a dimly lit stairway at night."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/3.jpg" alt="Chaotic frame of power poles, wires, and snippets of concrete building facades."><p>At first, things were difficult. A language I didn't speak, a half-assed effort to fit into the foreign social protocols of a vastly different society, and no friends or acquaintances.<br><br>Even among other international students I realized how varied peoples' values were. We tend to surround ourselves with the same set of people in our own bubble. In my case, these were artists, designers, and coders.<br><br>But in Japan, I met with people from all walks of life; ones that didn't care much for my hobbies or art.<br>I was used to sharing a portfolio and website as a conversation starter. Without that, I was left wondering how to find common ground.<br><br>But what began as a social challenge became the greatest blessing.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/4.jpg" alt="Dimly lit set of angularly staggered balconies with a pale green light coming from one of the glass doors."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/5.jpg" alt="Flat framing of a dimly lit staircase with a net grid in front of it."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/6.jpg" alt="Single slit of light between two modern buildings."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/7.jpg" alt="Outdoor stairway with windows on the other side of the building glowing red."><p>Productivity is all I cared for. But, in Japan, the way of life was simpler. Time didn't quite move as much, and the present remained in clear sight.<br><br>In my world, all we spoke about were projects, work, and careers.<br><br>But in Japan, among the friends I made, I faced a world where traditional career achievements mattered as little as they should.<br>Along with them, I let go of the burdens and anxieties that plague a reality where your worth is determined by anonymous followers and social validation.<br><br>I haven't let go of productivity, but now it shares my mental space with other fulfillment-breeding habits.<br>The struggle is never-ending, but each day spent focusing on what one enjoys doing is a step closer to stripping your happiness away from the hands of others and claiming it for yourself.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/8.jpg" alt="Outdoor stairway protected by an array of horizontal bars next to which a billboard with blue lighting shines."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/9.jpg" alt="Red Japanese lanterns hanging in an alley."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/10.jpg" alt="Dark canal with tall buildings at its edges lit in green."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/11.jpg" alt="Multilevel complex of distant modern buildings lit from the street below."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/12.jpg" alt="Blue net covering a set of metal support beams."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/13.jpg" alt="Dimly lit side of a modern building rooftop with air conditioning units and pipes on its facade."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/14.jpg" alt="Dark towering modern cluster of buildings dimly illuminated by their windwos."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/15.jpg" alt="Distant cluster of buildings dimly lit by the street below and their outdoor staircases."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/16.jpg" alt="Zoom-in to a facade with wooden boards over windows and an array of air conditioning units."><p>I yearn now for what I had in Japan.<br><br>The awkward handshakes and shy smiles of new acquaintences.<br><br>The late-night conbini runs, evenings out in the park, and nighttime conversations about the world and life.<br><br>The passionate professors who spoke with conviction about syntax, architecture, and games.<br><br>The rehearsals and live shows in tiny venues and warm crowds.<br><br>The trips through cities and mountains by car, and the exhausting hundreds of kilometers traversed on bicycles.<br><br>In short, I yearn for what my time in Japan has taught me: to pursue not only creation, but also experience.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/17.jpg" alt="Construction scaffolding wrapped in a green net at night."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/18.jpg" alt="Night time view of a cluster of buildings dimly illuminated from below."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/19.jpg" alt="Zoom-in to a dark gray building with dark green ceramic tiles and small red lights along its outdoor staircase."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/20.jpg" alt="Dark foggy modern building with a single illuminated window in red and the dark cloudy sky behind it."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/21.jpg" alt="Dimly lit modern building facade with many wires and some trees covering the view in the foreground."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/loveletter to japan/22.jpg" alt="Side of a train station at night lit in a dark green blue."><p>This is all extremely cliché - more than I'd like to admit - but this was the best year of my life. I wanted an adventure, and the experience fulfilled and exceeded those expectations.<br><br>To those who made that journey possible, to those who shared it with me, and to those who taught me so much. You know who you are. Thank you, and I look forward to sharing the next adventure with you.</p></div>
