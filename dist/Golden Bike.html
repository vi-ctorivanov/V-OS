				<h1><a href="Golden Bike.html" class="localLink">Golden Bike</a> is a documentation of a 360km bike trip across Japan.</h1><hr style="transform: translateX(0)"></hr><div id="content"><p>My friends Tomi and Taylor and I decided to take advantage of the time we had between semesters in Japan by going on a biking trip.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/1.jpg" alt="Photograph of an overcast road from the sidewalk with a cyclist futher ahead on the sidewalk."><p>We debated over the sites we would visit. We initially thought about flying out from Tokyo over to Osaka, and then biking south to Hiroshima.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/2.jpg" alt="Grassy and rocky coast on an overcast day."><p>"It's too inconvenient", we concluded. "The logistics of transporting a bike that far, or getting one there on short notice would be hard to manage."<br><br>Taylor suggested an idea that immediately caught my interest. "Why not go to Fuji?"</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/3.jpg" alt="Zoom-in of a red ladder on a facade covered in overgrown vegetation."><p>I loved the idea. And I thought about 富嶽三十六景 by 北斎 [36 Views of Mount Fuji, by Hokusai], a famous set of prints depicting Fuji and its surrounding landscapes, each taking a look at some element of Japanese culture and life. "Why not make our own?" I thought. Not as artsy, but more of a documentation of the landscapes we'd see. And so was spawned this album.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/4.jpg" alt="Red metal bridge over a canopy of trees with a smaller red bridge far under it."><p>We made the plan. Booked the AirBnBs. Acquired decent bikes and prepared the necessary equipment.</p><code class="codeBlock">360km.
6 days.
~60km per day.

</code class="codeBlock"><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/5.jpg" alt="Small boat in the sea."><p>The first two days weren't too bad. We got tired, naturally, but nothing too painful. Some climbs were annoying, but we survived.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/6.jpg" alt="Winding hills with lush vegetation."><p>But the third day was the real challenge. We decided to climb up Mount Hakone on our way to Fujinomiya. We got tired. <i>Very tired</i>.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/7.jpg" alt="Landscape with trees on hills and thin wisps of clouds on their peaks."><p>In fact, we nearly passed out. As it turns out, our preparation was not ideal, and we ran out of food and water halfway up.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/8.jpg" alt="Landscape with lush foggy hills and dim late evening lighting."><p>Though the sights were beautiful, they did little to motivate us when we had reached serious exhaustion. We had to take breaks every 5 minutes, where we would nearly fall asleep.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/9.jpg" alt="Sunny mountain road surrounded by vegetation."><p>Of course, at this point we were no longer biking. Only walking. It was not so much a challenge for the heart, but our legs could barely sustain our weight.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/10.jpg" alt="Green landscape with clouds covering the tops of the mountains."><p>I loved the challenge. Despite the discomfort, the feeling of putting all my focus and attention towards climbing this mountain gave me a sense of short-term purpose I could fully engage in.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/11.jpg" alt="White clouds in the blue sky."><p>And, we pushed through. Eventually, we made it to the top.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/12.jpg" alt="Distant lake surrounded by mountains."><p>It was gorgeous. Hakone has a lake that's formed near its peak, rendering the scenery even prettier. The ride down was a blast, too. We rested for 2 hours, and sped through the rest of the day.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/13.jpg" alt="Golden hour view of Mount Fuji with snow at its peak and clouds covering its base."><p>It was then we saw Fuji for the first time. It never looked that big, since there are no other large nearby mountains to compare it to.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/14.jpg" alt="Wide view of golden hour Mount Fuji."><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/15.jpg" alt="Field of cows with Mount Fuji in the background."><p>But as we approached it, its scale became apparent.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/16.jpg" alt="Edge of a lake with lush mountains in the background."><p>The next two days we visited lakes and roads surrounded by greenery.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/17.jpg" alt="Golden hour view of a lake surrounded by mountains."><p>And we bonded over the distance we had crossed, the challenges we had conquered, and the time we had spent together.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/18.jpg" alt="Vibrant sunset behind a mountain with a lake at the base."><p>Upon returning, it felt like we had been on a month+ long trip. Physically exhausted, but strangely mentally charged.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/19.jpg" alt="Pagoda with clouds covering a mountain in the background and a city below."><p>This was my first long-distance biking trip. It was without a doubt one of my best experiences in Japan. A true sense of adventure.</p><img class="textImage" src="https://v-os.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/golden bike/20.jpg" alt="Zoom-in of clouds casting a shadow over the base of a mountain."></p><p></div>
