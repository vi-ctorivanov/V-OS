title: #[DotCycle] is a narrative game taking place in archived memories of an #[atomic AI].
content:

?[Operator, this is the most intact instance so far. I think it's our best chance at understanding why they keep shutting themselves off.]

#[DotCycle] is a recorded exploration of archived memories from one of the last unsuccessful #[atomic AI]. Composed from poetry, music, and environments that coalesce into a representation of the subject's most remarkable memories.

Explore these archived memories, and learn of the AI's revalations about sentience, free of will, and purpose.
